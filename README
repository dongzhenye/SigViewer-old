Compiling
---------

SigViewer depends on the following external libraries:

- QT 4 (qt4-core and qt4-gui)
  http://www.qtsoftware.com
- libgdf
  http://libgdf.sourceforge.net
- biosig4c++
  http://biosig.sourceforge.net

General building steps:

1. install qt4 development packages

2. download the "extern"-archive which fits to your platform from http://sigviewer.sf.net

3. extract the "extern"-archive into the sigviewer-directory (in the same directory where "sigviewer.pro" is located)

4. use qmake to generate a makefile and call make:
   qmake sigviewer.pro && make

The SigViewer binary can be found in the "bin" directory (release or debug)



Building Installation Packages
------------------------------

Debian / Ubuntu / Kubuntu:
  1. build/compile SigViewer

  2. run the script build-deb.sh
        ./build-deb.sh
  
  3. the deb file is automatically generated
